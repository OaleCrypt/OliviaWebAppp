Step-by-Step Guidance for Continuing the Project:
Step 1: Finalize api_data.html Structure
We’ve already created a basic structure for api_data.html. Let’s ensure it meets our needs:

It should summarize data from the Shodan, AbuseIPDB, and GreyNoise APIs.
Each section should display key information and link to a detailed view.
Step 2: Ensure Data Fetching Works
We need to ensure that our data fetching for each API is functioning as expected:

Check the URLs for each API call in the views.
Validate that the data is parsed correctly and displayed in the template.
Step 3: Update Detailed Views for Each API
Each API should have a detailed view that displays comprehensive data:

Shodan: Detailed information about an IP address.
AbuseIPDB: Reports and details about an IP’s malicious activity.
GreyNoise: Context and insights about IP noise and classifications.
Step 4: Implement Dynamic Data Updates (Optional)
For a more dynamic and responsive dashboard:

Use JavaScript to periodically fetch data without reloading the page.
Ensure that the dashboard updates with the latest data automatically.

Step 5: Style the Dashboard
Apply CSS to make the dashboard visually appealing and consistent:

Use a common stylesheet (style.css) located in integrations/static/integrations/css/.
Ensure it doesn’t interfere with other app-specific styles in the SOC app.
Step 6: Integrate Navigation and Extend Templates
Ensure seamless navigation between different sections:

Use base_generic.html for common layout elements.
Include navigation links to allow users to move between the dashboard and detailed views.
Step 7: Test and Optimize
Thoroughly test the dashboard and individual views:

Validate that the data displays correctly.
Check for performance issues and optimize loading times.
Ensure the layout is responsive and looks good on different devices.

Step 2: Ensure Data Fetching Works
We need to confirm that the data fetching logic in our views is correct. Here’s a checklist:

Shodan API:

Verify the API URL and the request method.
Ensure the API key is valid and included in the request.
Handle errors and display appropriate messages in the template.
AbuseIPDB API:

Confirm the endpoint and request parameters.
Include the API key in the request headers.
Parse and display data accurately.
GreyNoise API:

Check the URL structure and headers.
Validate the response and extract necessary information.
Display data in a user-friendly format.

Step 3: Update Detailed Views for Each API
Update the detailed views to display comprehensive data:

Shodan (shodan_view.html):
Display detailed information like IP, organization, ISP, country, ports, and services.
Provide a clear layout for the data fetched.

AbuseIPDB (abuseipdb_view.html):
Show IP details, domain, reports, and any other relevant information.

GreyNoise (greynoise_view.html):
Present the noise status, classification, and other contextual data.
